# Research

My research advances thermal-fluid sciences across phase change heat transfer, reactive multiphase transport, and acoustic sensing in energy and power systems. I integrate experimental prototyping, multiscale modeling, machine learning, and material development to address challenges in energy storage, thermal management, and clean energy systems.
