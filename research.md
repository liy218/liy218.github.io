# Research

My research advances thermal-fluid sciences across phase change heat transfer, reactive multiphase transport, and acoustic sensing in energy and power systems. I integrate experimental prototyping, multiscale modeling, machine learning, and material development to address challenges in energy storage, thermal management, and clean energy systems.

## Thermal Energy Storage & Phase Change Materials

Phase change materials (PCMs) enable temporal thermal buffering for sustainable energy systems. I developed CaCl₂·6H₂O-based latent heat storage modules to improve dry cooling systems in power plants by shifting ambient heat from daytime to nighttime. 

**Key contributions:**
- Designed and synthesized PCM composites with enhanced thermal properties through additive engineering
- First to micro-encapsulate PCM into lightweight aggregates for porous latent heat energy storage (LHES) modules
- Performed atomic-scale molecular dynamics simulations to understand CaCl₂ solution behavior and freezing point depression
- Experimental evaluation in a 23-ft custom heat transfer wind tunnel demonstrated robust heat shifting and ~5% power-output gain at high ambient temperatures

This work establishes a pathway for integrating thermal energy storage into existing power infrastructure to improve efficiency and reduce peak thermal loads.

## Additive Manufacturing of Porous Structures

Porous materials are essential to many energy technologies, where pore architecture controls coupled transport of mass, heat, and momentum. I advanced laser powder bed fusion techniques to fabricate tailored porous structures for thermal systems.

**Key contributions:**
- Optimized L-PBF parameters (scan strategy, laser power, scanning speed) for titanium alloy (Ti64) loop heat pipe evaporators
- Achieved low effective pore radii (<10 μm) and high permeability (~10⁻¹¹ m²) in 3D-printed wick structures
- Developed microstructure-performance relationships for additively manufactured porous thermal components

This research enables direct manufacturing of application-specific porous geometries, bridging the gap between computational design and experimental realization of advanced thermal systems.

## Acoustic Sensing & Machine Learning for Multiphase Flows

Acoustic emission (AE) sensing offers a non-destructive way to capture fast dynamic processes in thermal-fluid systems. I established an AE-ML framework for flow condensation characterization that enables quantitative heat transfer analysis without intrusive measurements.

**Key contributions:**
- Developed acoustic signature-based methods for identifying flow regimes in condensation (slug flow, annular flow)
- Integrated machine learning with AE power spectra for quantitative characterization of phase change heat transfer
- Demonstrated non-destructive diagnostics capability for multiphase flow systems

This work opens promising paths for real-time monitoring and control of thermal systems where traditional sensors cannot be deployed.
